# README Generator
### DESCRIPTION
  In this project, we were tasked in cerating a readme.md generator with javascript so we can create a readme file automatically.  This allows for more time to work on the task at hand rather than spend time on a readme file.

###INSTALLATION
  You must download the code.  And you must use node and specifically use inquirer and fs to help produce the readme.
  
### USAGE
  You run node index.js in your terminal in the correct folder.  You will answer a series of questions to help generate the read.me file. The readme will be produced in the readmetest file. You can use that information to help create the readme file.  Also, there is a video that can help you use this information.
